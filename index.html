/* 2 --Write a java progrom for the following scenario -
-> A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with 
no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

A sentence can be shuffled by appending the 1-indexed word position to each word then 
rearranging the words in the sentence.

For example, the sentence "This is a sentence" can be shuffled as
"sentence4 a3 is2 This1" or "is2 sentence4 This1 a3".

Given a shuffled sentence s containing no more than 9 words, reconstruct and return 
the original sentence.

Example 1:
Input:is2 sentence4 This1 a3
Output:This is a sentence

Example 2:
Input:Myself2 Me1 I4 and3
Output:Me Myself and I


Constraints:
2 <= s.length <= 10
The number of words in s is between 1 and 9.
The words in s are separated by a single space.
s contains no leading or trailing spaces.

/* 3 -- Write a java program with the following scenario -

- You are given a string s of even length. Split this string into two halves of equal lengths,
and let a be the first half and b be the second half.

- Two strings are alike if they have the same number of consonants
Notice that s contains uppercase and lowercase letters.

Return true if a and b are alike. Otherwise, return false.

Example 1:
Input: book
Output: true
Explanation: a = "bo" and b = "ok". a has 1 consonant and b has 1 consonant. 
Therefore, they are alike.

Example 2:
Input: textbook
Output: false
Explanation: a = "text" and b = "book". a has 3 consonants and b has 2 consonants. 
Therefore, they are not alike.

Constraints:
=> 2 <= s.length <= 100
=> s.length is even.
=> s consists of uppercase and lowercase letters.
